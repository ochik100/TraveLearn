# TraveLearn

### Introduction

Imagine a graphical network representation of all the people in the world, where two people are connected upon any type of interaction. In this graph, an edge has formed between your node and mine; I am now very curious as to why.

TraveLearn creates a network representation of travelers in the United States based on their interactions with other travelers on Trip Advisor travel forums.
